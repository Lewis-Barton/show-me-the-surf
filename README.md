# **[Show Me The Surf]()**

# **Project Description**

This project has been developed for my second Milestone project assignment following the Code Institute course that I am currently completing. I have chosen an idea that was given from the list give in the assessment criteria of "Create a site that calls an API to help the user choose a holiday based on their needs"

From this I have decided to create a website that allows the user to search for a holiday based on where would have the best surf (tidal data) for their chosen dates. To do this I have looked at suitable APIs that have this information available, I will manipulate their data and evaluate the information that has been returned.

For this project I have had to make some of the following assumptions. The website itself does not provide travel packages but will instead operate through partner websites instead.

From these assumptions and the information, I have gathered I am using the 5 planes of UX methodology that has been explained within the course to; identify the user needs, the features are needed in the design, how the information is structured and logically grouped. These have then been used to produce a wireframe to show how this is implemented and a basis for what the project will look like on completion.
