# **HTML**

## **Index**

Initial check for errors in code done using [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)

- `<a>` must not appear as a descendant of the `<button>` element.
  - I was able to resolve this by removing the link and button and adding in an input element and then adding the form action to redirect to the next page.
- **Warning**

  - Section Two does not have a header element, this is not an issue in this case.

  The page was then checked for spelling mistakes using Word.

**Browser testing**
I tested this page using the built in function of Safari to check between multiple devices and different browser software.

Because I have used SCSS for this site, it has already adapted the CSS files to ensure that it is all displayed correctly.

I have also done multiple media queries to ensure that the website looks and functions as it should on all devices, keeping in mind that it has been developed as a mobile first site.
